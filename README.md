# Cards
[Live Demo](https://card-storage.netlify.app/)

As the developer of this web application, I utilized React to create a functional and visually appealing user experience. Upon navigating to the designated tab, users are presented with a collection of cards that are specific to their account. To enhance the user's ability to locate specific cards, I implemented a search function that allows for filtering by card name. In addition, a filter dropdown has been implemented to further narrow down search results. To ensure seamless navigation within the application, I employed the React Router library for routing purposes. In order to effectively manage the application's state, I implemented the Context API and useReducer hook. Overall, the resulting project is a well-structured and intuitive platform for users to interact with.
