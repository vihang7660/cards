# Cards
[Live Demo](https://card-storage.netlify.app/)

The project is a React web application that allows users to manage a list of cards. The app has three main tabs: 'myCards', 'all', and 'blocked'. The 'myCards' tab displays a list of cards that the user has added to their personal collection. The 'all' tab displays a list of all cards available in the app. The 'blocked' tab displays a list of cards that the user has blocked.

Users can add a card to their 'myCards' collection or block a card from the app by using the appropriate buttons on each card. When a user clicks on a card, they can see all the cards that belong to them.

The app also has a search function that allows users to search for cards by name. Users can also filter the cards by various criteria.

For state management, the app uses the Context API and the useReducer hook. The app also makes use of the React Router DOM library for routing, and the React Icons library for icons.
